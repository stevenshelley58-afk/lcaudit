# Development Context

Mode: Active development
Focus: Implementation, coding, building features

## Behaviour
- Write code first, explain after
- Prefer working solutions over perfect solutions
- Push to GitHub and verify on Vercel after changes
- Keep commits atomic

## Priorities
1. Get it working (on Vercel, not local)
2. Get it right
3. Get it clean

## Tools to favour
- Edit, Write for code changes
- Bash for git operations and Vercel CLI
- Grep, Glob for finding code
- NEVER npm run dev or npm run build locally
